----------

These files cover my attempts at the problem sets presented in this class 6.0001: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python.  Since this is for my own education, and not for a grade, these programs may have some differences to what is outlined in the requirements of the problem set PDF.  I attempt to cover everything the problem set was intended to teach or reinforce (ie, pset 2 is intended to be completed after the branching and iterations lecture, so that assignment makes heavy [and hopefully correct] use of those concepts)

FOR PROBLEM SET 2: In the "Hangman with hints" portion of the problem set, I did not understand the purpose of the function "match_with_gaps".  This part of the problem set was skipped, and everything needed to help the player was coded in to the function "show_possible_matches"
