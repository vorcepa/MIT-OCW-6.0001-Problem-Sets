----------

These files cover my attempts at the problem sets presented in this class 6.0001: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python.

FOR PROBLEM SET 2: In the "Hangman with hints" portion of the problem set, I did not understand the purpose of the function "match_with_gaps".  This part of the problem set was skipped, and everything needed to help the player was coded in to the function "show_possible_matches"
